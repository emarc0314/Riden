### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
    - Travel
- **Mobile:**
    - People looking for rides will be out of their home already, so easier to look on laptop.
    - Profile personalization will require photo, and taking a photo of the ride
- **Story:**
    - Allows for people to find rides from people around their campus, to make it a safer, more reliable trip.
- **Market:**
    - Anyone who needs a ride places could use this app to get groceries/go home, and anyone who wishes to not drive alone could put themselves on the app.
- **Habit:**
    - people might consistently need rides on weekends to get grocieries or run daily tasks, which could create a routine of using the app to find those kinds of rides.
- **Scope:**
    - This app will have around 3 views at most; the profile view, the rides view, and the post a ride View. Post a ride view may have additional nested flow views. 
## Product Spec

### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)
**Required Must-have Stories**

* Marcus Aurelius is trying to get back home to New Jersey for the summer, but can't seem to find a ride and does't want to say another day! He opens Rideshare and sees that a friend of a friend is traveling THAT NIGHT and has an extra seat available, so he requests to join and gets home to his family :^)
* Socrates is driving back to Philadelphia for winter break, but realzies that the drive is 3+ hours long and would really like company for the ride. He decides to put himself on the app, and hears back within seconds that someone would like to join his ride! It's a friend of his close friend Plato, so they will have something to talk about.
* Every user wil initially have to login in order to access data about rides they are being offered.
 
**Optional Nice-to-have Stories**

* Plato would love to put himself on the app, but he doesn't like that there doesn't seem to be any structured compensation for giving a ride. However, a new update of the app recently came out that allows for ridees to ask the riders to venmo them some certain amount, and once that amout is reached they could authenticate the ride.
